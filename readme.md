This is a bot that I'm making for fun that works on discord servers!

At the moment, the deafult bot command prefix is '!'
Please make sure the bot is online before adding it your server.

Current Features: 
1. Hello/Goodbye message when a user Joins/Leaves 
2. !hello message which triggers a greeting from the bot 
3. Basic embed 
4. Moderation features - clear messages, kick, ban, unban
5. Customizable prefixe with !setprefix command - Hasn't  been tested yet
-- Starting here, each(significant) feature will be worked on in a separate branch --
6. Logging
7. !weather {cityname} command that fetches the current weather for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API
8. !avatar @username command that displays the avatar of the specified user
9. SQL database to store information


Planned Features:
1. Embeds for gifs, twitter, etc
2. Block certain words - a la delete the forbidden message and post a warning to that user 
3. LastFM integration
4. Spotify integration? 
5. Starboard integration
6. Tests
7. Lots of fun commands that display certain pictures/gifs and more
8. level system
9. Error handling ? 
10. Birthday Messages
11. Slash commands
12. !userinfo command
13. add logger to all the cogs so they log

Next features to work on: 7, 8, 1, 2 (Not necessarily in that order)

Additional notes for myself:
- Figure out debugging in VS Code - watch video

\\ NOTE TO SELF: Before making the repo public, must delete the history of main.py and apikeys.py. Good practice for github ^-^
